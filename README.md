## Nikolas Schmidt - Portfolio

## Background
I'm a software developer from the greater Pittsburgh area. This site serves as a portfolio of several projects I've worked on over the years.

## Projects
Below are links to some of my projects and a bit of background about them.
* [XKCD Recommender](https://xkcd-recommender.onrender.com)
  * This project was designed to highlight the use of three different machine learning clustering algorithms by running all three on the same dataset - XKCD comics!
  * This site is running on a free host, and as such, may take time to connect if it has to spin up if it has not been accessed recently. Likewise, searches may take time to generate results.
* [Covid Collector](https://document-search.onrender.com)
  * This project uses natural language processing to identify Covid-19 documents that are similar to one another in order to help researchers find other studies that pertain to their work. This uses only a small set of documents and has not been expanded to the entire corpus.

* [WUBRG](http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~jackson/StudentWork/SchmidtPaperFinal.pdf)
  * My final project in undergrad was a full-stack web application using Django. The site has been turned offline due to the cost of keeping it available, but the paper describing it is linked to here.
* [*A Survey on Blockchain for Information Systems Management and Security*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102397)
  * An article I co-authored in my grad program, this piece describes developments in Blockchain in recent years and how these can be implemented to better information systems in any domain.
* [*A Survey on Edge Intelligence and Lightweight Machine Learning Support for Future Applications and Services*](https://doi.org/10.1145/3581759)
  * Another article I co-authored in my grad program, this work focuses on approaches to enhancing edge computing and applications for furthering its use, covering opportunities for domain growth as well as algorithms which edge computing and edge intelligence can leverage.
* [LRP Geospatial Site](https://geospatial-lrp.usace.army.mil/)
  * With the US Army Corps of Engineers, I've developed several websites. Though most are internal to the Corps, this one is available to the general public and shows some of the projects the Corps works on and some really cool web maps I designed.
  * I no longer maintain this site and as such, can't be assured that all functionality on the site is still available.
* [GitHub License Analysis](https://github-license-analysis.onrender.com)
	* A small website I made for an undergrad class on copyright law, this page details some of the different licenses available by default for projects on GitHub, my understanding of those licenses, and how putting forth default options can impact a developer's ownership of their independent projects.
	* This site is running on a free host, and as such, may take time to connect if it has to spin up if it has not been accessed recently.
* [*Are We There Yet*](https://ccdigitalpress.org/book/arewethereyet/)
	* This project was in collaboration with authors [James Purdy and Jennifer Marlow](https://ccdigitalpress.org/book/arewethereyet/authors/), discussing *The History Book* and trends in teaching and technology over the years. Written and developed throughout my time in both undergrad and grad school at Duquesne University, I was the original developer and designer of the project, working with the authors to bring their vision to life.
	* Some changes have occurred since publication that I was not affiliated with.
